# lab4-CNN
Welcome to Lab 4 of the Machine Learning Series prepared by the VTC STEM Education Centre.

In this lab you will implement a convolution neural network using Keras. You will train the network model to classify the images of 12 classes of plant seedlings. The image dataset, "Plant Seedlings Dataset", is downloaded from and owned by the Computer Vision and Biosystems Signal Processing Group, Aarhus University, Denmark.

You will first use Keras to implement a simple CNN to establish a baseline of the model performance. Then you will try to achieve a better performance by 
i) fine-tuning the model
ii) building a slightly deeper CNN and 
iii) using the technique of "Transferred Learning" and adopting the pre-trained weights of the famous VGG-16 model into your model.

Upon completion of this lab, you should be familiarized with the syntax of Keras and grasp the basic workflow of building a deep neural network in solving image-related problems.
